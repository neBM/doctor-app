Version Control Plan

- Use of Branching  
One of the main things we plan on doing is using the branching feature in git for each of the new features we intend to add throughout the development. We will be utilising this to ensure that any changes we make, we are able to quickly revert any changes without affecting the overall master branch, once a particular feature is complete and is ready to be added, it will be merged with the master branch and no more changes will be made to it. Any changes to the code that we write with be outside of the master branch and in its corresponding branch until it is complete and ready to be moved. This just makes version control much easier for us in the long run as any mistakes we make or anything we decide we want to change will be much easier to implement and fix within a separate branch and will have much less risk involved when deleting code. It also makes the organisation of the code much easier as well as we will know where to find the particular features that we need at any time as the branches will all be named in a way that it clearly shows what feature it is for. Branches would also be used should any bug be found later on in the development process, if we were to find a bug, we would then create a branch so that we can implement the code to fix the bug outside the master branch and then merge again when we need to.

- How often changes will be pushed?  
We will try to push changes whenever a new part of a feature has been added, for example, the button that will be used to take a doctor to their bookings for that day. This is to ensure that we have the most up to data versions available and then if a serious error occurs that we cannot fix or something goes wrong with the code, we would be able to access a very recent version of the code without losing a large chunk of it in the process. These changes will only be pushed to the branch it is involved with until the feature is complete at which point it would be merged with the master branch as stated above. 

-  How it will be used to locate and solve any bugs?  
The benefit of updating often is that it allows us to easily identify what part of a code as caused an issue if we had not tested in a while or had not found a bug until later in development as we would be able to go back through the previous versions of the source code running the same test until we don't get that error, this would allow us to locate the potential area of code that is causing any issues within our application and then work on solving them within the most recent version of our code.
