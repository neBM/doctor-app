**Sprint 1:**

- The system should allow a user to log in with their username and password, and 
  log out. Every time the user logs in, the system should show the userâ€™s new

  functionality and when.

              provided is wrong.  
            - Retrieve new messages and display them (which you receive from back 
              end).

        - Back End:
            - test if the input (email and password) matches what is in the 
              database. Two tests, first check email exist in database, second

              test are true return true to front end developer, else return false.
            - given the user(doctor email) retrive unread new messages. Your task 
              is to provide the sorted table of messages to the front end 
              developer.
            - Log each action from the user in a table. Time when accessed 
              welcome screen, everytime the user interacts/clicks a function on 
              the interafect a new entry is added to the log database.

              returned to the welcomed screen where the new message is displayed 
              that the added information/message has successfully been added.
            - If entry check returns false,  pop up a window stating what entry 
              is incorrect and allow user to reenter info.   
        - Back End:
            - Create a database for patients and have a functionality that

              conflict with a pre-existing entry.
            - Have a method that checks the email/id and name do correspond to 
              the email/id  saved in the database.
            - If it passes the test successfully add the new info in the 
              corresponding database of the patient.     
            - Add a message to the message database staying the info has been 
              added with the info that has been added. 
            - Adding a getMessages method to display on welcome screen.
